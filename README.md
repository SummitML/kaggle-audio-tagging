## Contributing

### Downloading the Repository

1. With [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed, clone this repository. If you're using the command line interface run...

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SummitML/kaggle-audio-tagging.git
  ```

### Downloading the Kaggle Data

1. Create a directory at the root of your project called **data**

  ```bash
  cd /path/to/kaggle-audio-tagging/
  mkdir data
  ```

1. Download project data files from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/data)

1. Find your downloaded files and move them into your newly created `data` directory.

  ```bash
  mv /path/to/downloaded/file /path/to/kaggle-audio-tagging/data
  ```

### Installing Dependencies

**Python**

There are various ways to install Python. Python3 is recommended for this project.

- [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python)

**Running the Virtual Environment**

With Python (and [PIP](https://pypi.org/)) installed, you're now ready to install a virtual environment and run it locally...

With [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/
)...

```bash
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

*Note: When adding new dependencies to the project with Pipenv, remember to [generate](https://docs.pipenv.org/advanced/#generating-a-requirements-txt) an updated `requirements.txt` for teammates not using Pipenv*

With [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)...
```bash
virtualenv venv # -> creates local environment
source venv/bin/activate # -> activates shell
pip install -r requirements.txt # -> dependencies
```

With [Virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)...

```bash
make create_environment
```

Once inside an isolated virtual environment (using any of the methods above), you can confirm your environment was set up correctly by running the provided `make` command...

```bash
make test_environment
```

### Git Workflow

Please reference Atlassians tutorial on the [Git Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

**Branching Strategy**

For the purposes of this project, we'll rely on three primary branch types.

- Feature Branches - A working branch created by any team member for independent or paired development

- Develop - A reserved branch for code that has been peer reviewed and is production ready

- Master - A restricted branch that represents deployed production code
